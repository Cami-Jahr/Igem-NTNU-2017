            <h1>Antibiotics resistance â€“ a big, global challenge</h1>
            <p>
                Antibiotic resistance is poised to become one of the greatest dangers of our time. Since its discovery
                in 1928, antibiotics have been our first line of defense against bacterial infections. Antibiotics have
                saved countless lives, and made difficult and complex surgeries possible [1]. For half a century we have
                enjoyed the golden age of antibiotics where we have had no reason to fear bacterial infections. But this
                golden age is coming to an end. Widespread misuse of antibiotics, coupled with minimal investment in new
                treatments have allowed pathogenic bacteria to develop resistances to many antibiotics. Our best defense
                against the bacteria have now created one of our greatest medical threats. [2]

                        The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) have confirmed that the United States and the
                        rest of the world are amid an emerging crisis of antibiotic resistance for microbial pathogens
                        [2]. In 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that antibiotic resistance is one of the
                        biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today. [3]
                        <br><br>
                        As antibiotics are losing their effect, invasive surgeries such as organ transplants, joint
                        replacements and cardiac surgeries will become difficult and expensive. People undergoing
                        chemotherapy or taking any immunosuppressants will be in a lot more danger of contracting
                        deadly infections. An increasing number of infections, such as pneumonia, gonorrhea and
                        tuberculosis, are becoming difficult to treat because the antibiotics previously used are
                        starting to become less effective [3]. The threat of antibiotic resistance has led to policies
                        for restrictive use of antibiotics, but many countries have already given up the battle against
                        certain antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus),
                        common in hospitals. If these policies fail, the need for an alternative will be vital.

            <h1>Bacteriophages as an alternative to antibiotics</h1>
            <p>
                Fortunately, antibiotics are not the only natural enemies of bacteria. Bacteriophages, or phages for
                short, are tiny, bacteria-specific viruses capable of infecting selected bacteria while leaving other
                bacteria, as well as animal and plant cells, unharmed. They are one of the most widespread biological
                units in the biosphere, and exist anywhere bacteria can be found, for instance in soil, water and animal
                intestines. In nature there is a continuous battle between phages and bacteria, with the consequence
                that for every bacterium there probably exists one bacteriophage capable of killing it. Bacteriophages
                might therefore be an interesting topic to look into in the search for alternatives to antibiotics.

                        The bacteriophages were discovered in the beginning of the 20th century, and scientists early
                        suggested using them to counter bacterial infections. With the discovery of antibiotics, however,
                        scientists in the Western world lost the interest in bacteriophages, and the research on phages
                        was primarily conducted in the Soviet union, especially in what is now the country of Georgia.
                        During the second world war, Soviet soldiers used bacteriophages as treatment for infections,
                        and there still exists a phage therapy center in Tbilisi, Georgia today [4]. Phage therapy had
                        a bad reputation for a long time, mostly because of poor documentation and research methods,
                        but currently, under the threat of antibiotic resistance, the interest in bacteriophages is
                        rising once again.[5]
                        <br><br>
                        Phage therapy does however have several issues to be ironed out before becoming a mainstream
                        medical treatment.[5] One major stumbling block for phage therapy is the high host specificity
                        of phages. Most phages can only infect certain strains of a bacterial species. This creates the
                        need for either large libraries of potential phages, or a quick method of developing a phage
                        capable of fighting a given bacterial infection. In order to solve this problem, our project
                        attempts to investigate the latter method.
