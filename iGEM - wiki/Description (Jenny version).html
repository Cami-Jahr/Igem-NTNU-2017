                Antibiotic resistance is poised to become one of the greatest dangers of our time. Since its discovery in 1928, antibiotics have been our first line of defense against bacterial infections. Antibiotics have saved countless lives, and made difficult and complex surgeries possible [1], and for half a century we have enjoyed the golden age of antibiotics where we have had no reason to fear bacterial infections. But this golden age is coming to an end. Widespread misuse of antibiotics, coupled with minimal investment in new treatments have allowed pathogenic bacteria to develop resistances to many antibiotics. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) have confirmed that the United States and the rest of the world are amid an emerging crisis of antibiotic resistance for microbial pathogens [2]. In 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today. [3] <br><br>


                As antibiotics are losing their effect, invasive surgeries such as organ transplants, joint replacements and cardiac surgeries will become difficult and expensive. People undergoing chemotherapy or taking any immunosuppressants will be in a lot more danger of contracting deadly infections. An increasing number of infections, such as pneumonia, gonorrhea and tuberculosis, are becoming difficult to treat because the antibiotics previously used are starting to become less effective [3]. The threat of antibiotic resistance has led to policies for restrictive use of antibiotics, but many countries have already given up the battle against certain antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, common in hospitals. If these policies fail, the need for an alternative will be vital. <br><br>



                Fortunately, antibiotics are not the only natural enemies of bacteria. Bacteriophages, or phages for short, are tiny, bacteria-specific viruses capable of infecting select bacteria while leaving other bacteria, as well as animal and plant cells, unharmed. They are one of the most widespread biological unities in the biosphere, and exist anywhere bacteria can be found, for instance in soil, water and animal intestines. In nature there is a continuous battle between phages and bacteria, with the consequence that for every bacterium there probably exists one bacteriophage capable of killing it.<br><br>

                The bacteriophages were discovered in the beginning of the 20th century, and scientists early suggested using them to counter bacterial infections. With the discovery of antibiotics, however, scientists in the Western world lost the interest in bacteriophages, and the research on phages were primarily conducted in the Soviet union, especially in what is now the country of Georgia. During the second world war, Soviet soldiers used bacteriophages as treatment for infections, and there still exists a phage therapy centre in Tblisi, Georgia today. Phage therapy had a bad reputation for a long time, mostly because of poor documentation and research methods, but currently, under the threat of antibiotic resistance, the interest in bacteriophages is rising once again. <br><br>

                Phage therapy does however have several issues to be ironed out before becoming a mainstream medical treatment. One major stumbling block for phage therapy is the high host specificity of phages. Most phages can only infect certain strains of a bacterial species. This creates the need for either large libraries of potential phages, or a quick method of developing a phage capable of fighting a given bacterial infection. In order to solve this problem, our project attempts to investigate the latter method.<br><br>

            <p>
                For our project, we aim to develop a method of evolving phages capable of infecting
                a target bacteria strain. We plan to first harvest a catalogue of phages and identify
                their host bacteria. Phages are plentiful in nature, and by taking different water and
                soil samples, we will collect a variety of phages capable of infecting different
                bacteria.  By genetically modifying host bacteria, we will accelerate the natural
                mutation rate of our respective phages. We plan to set up a controlled environment that
                favorizes phages capable of also infecting the target bacteria. We believe this method will
                be capable of quickly producing tailored phages, keeping us one step ahead of the resistant
                bacteria.
