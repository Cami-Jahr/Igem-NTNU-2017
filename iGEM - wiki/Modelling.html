                We achieved two main goals;
                <br><br>
                We designed a mathematical model for phage-bacteria interaction. This work expands upon existing models

                <br><br>
                We applied our mathematical model to our chemostat system and determined ideal parameters for our
                experimental project. We then utilized these parameters when implementing our physical system
                (see results below).

            <h1>Modelling phages</h1>
            <p>
                Phages are infectious viruses that kill certain bacteria. When a phage finds a bacterium to infect, it
                attaches and inserts itself into the bacterium, and hijacks the bacterium’s cellular machinery to create
                lots of copies of itself. After a short period, the new phage particles will burst out of the now dead
                bacterium (lysis), ready to infect new bacteria. We used existing mathematical models of this interaction,
                and expanded upon them.

                        A simple model for one bacteria and one phage in a closed system is easily obtained. As a starting
                        point, we used the model detailed in [1] without mutation. This model and all following models
                        assumes mass-action kinetics between bacteria and phages; the rate of infection is proportional
                        to the product of the concentrations of the two.

                        of time before lysing. To create a more realistic model, we adapted the model to deal with variable
                        lysis times; we assume a lysis probability function normally distributed around the average lysis
                        time T. This requires an additional variable I, a vector function that keeps track of all infected
                        bacteria and when they were infected. By convoluting the probability distribution function f of
                        a bacterium lysing with the infection vector I, we obtain the number of new lysed bacteria at
                        time t.

            <h1>Modelling chemostats</h1>
            <p>
                Our motivation for modelling phage-bacteria interactions is to provide our wet lab with appropriate
                parameters for accomplishing our goal. That is, using our chemostat system to evolve a phage capable
                of killing a select strain of bacteria. We described our system mathematically and wrote a C++ program
                to numerically solve the system of integro-differential equations. Matlab was used for plotting. Using
                this, we determined parameters to optimally evolve a capable phage and test out project.

                        Fig. 2 shows a simulation of equation set (6) with typical parameters (see constants list). All
                        four biological species are graphed over 12 hours. However, this model does not allow for the
                        mutation of bacteria and phages which our system relies on. In order to obtain graphs such as
                        Fig. 2 it was necessary to initialize with a small number of phage P2 in the system. Our system
                        mostly assumes mutations that give rise to P2 will not occur before steady state, so this is a
                        limitation of the model.

                        However, we still managed to put the model to good use by optimizing quantities which should

                        Fig. 3 shows this plot. There is clearly a maximum around an exchange rate of 1.25 h<sup>-1</sup>.
                        This should maximize the speed at which bacteria develop resistance to a phage in the chemostat.

                        (OD600), so wanted to make sure the OD600 would not be too low at this exchange rate. We also wanted

                        Fig. 4 shows that these concerns were unwarranted at an exchange rate of around 1.25 h<sup>-1</sup>, with
                        an equilibrium OD600 of 1.4, and equilibrium reached after <20h.  We also see at an exchange rate
                        above 1.8 h<sup>-1</sup>, the bacteria are unable to keep up and are washed out. For these reasons, and
                        exchange rate very close to the theoretical optimum of 1.25 was utilized when implementing our
